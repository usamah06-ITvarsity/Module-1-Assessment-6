         <p><b>Nike, Inc., is one of the largest and best-recognized global sports and athleticwear brands. Its extensive lineup includes its long-running Air Jordan, Air Force 1, and other “Air” models. Converse shoes and apparel have also been a part of Nike since its 2003 acquisition. Nike is known for its celebrity endorsement deals with top athletes, including Tiger Woods, LeBron James, and Serena Williams. The company has stayed relevant with consumers over the years through its savvy marketing, which includes embracing controversial topics. Since 2020, Nike has been led by president and CEO John Donahoe, but cofounder and long-time CEO Phil Knight remains active in the company, serving as chair emeritus.</b></p>
         <p>Innovative marketing. The “Just Do It” slogan focuses not on the glory of winning, but the hard work and daily struggle of putting in the effort no matter what. That philosophy is psychological and applies beyond the world of sports to any goal. Nike’s imagery enhances the slogan, focusing on everyday people overcoming obstacles and embracing positions that are seemingly at odds with the status quo.<br/>
<b>Quality and style. Nike backs up its marketing with quality products and continuous design experimentation, seeking to strike a balance between what consumers want and the functional needs of athletes. Each product division is positioned as a unique offering to build loyalty within a particular sport. Nike’s marketing and product offerings give credence to each other. For example, a marketing focus on struggles that women athletes face helps promote its products designed specifically for women’s bodies.<br/>
Audience focus. Nike has an expansive, insight-driven, customer-centric strategy centered in sport and youth culture. It focuses on the shopping experience and personalization to build brand loyalty. Nike was early to adopt online sales and invested in digital technology that provides even more insight into its customers’ changing needs.<br/>
Strategic expansion. Nike’s acquisitions focused on products core to its mission and allowed it to expand from footwear to include apparel and fitness with apps and equipment that help the company reach not just athletes, but anyone looking to lead a healthier lifestyle.</b></p>
